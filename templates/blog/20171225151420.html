<h2>do - while statement - Repeated processing, always executed first</h2>



You can use the <b> do-while statement </b> to describe iterative processing. Unlike <a href="/blog/20100123126425.html">while statement</a>, the part described by the do block is always executed once at the beginning.

<pre>
do {
  # Repeat process
}
while (condition)
</pre>

<h4>do - while statement is deprecated</h4>

It is not recommended to use the do-while statement.

The first reason is that <a href="/blog/20170527149589.html">last</a> and <a href="/blog/20080329120687.html">next</a> are in the do block. Because it doesn't work properly. This seems to work, but it doesn't work, which can be confusing.

The second reason is that the exact same processing as the do-while statement can be described using <a href="/blog/20100123126425.html">while statement</a>.
