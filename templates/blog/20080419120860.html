<h2> qr operator-create a regular expression reference </h2>



You can create a <a href="/blog/20100827127859.html">regular expression</a> reference with the <strong> qr operator </strong>. You can use the qr operator to save a regular expression as a reference in a variable. You can also save regular expression options. Regular expressions are compiled, so they work faster when doing repeated pattern matching.

<pre>
# Regular expression reference
my $regex = qr/\ d +/sm;
</pre>

When performing pattern matching, you can put it in // or use it as it is. I think it's a little easier to see if you put it in //.

<pre>
Used in # //
if ($str =~ /$regex /) {
  ...
}

# Use as it is
if ($str =~ $regex) {
  ...
}
</pre>

<h3> What is a reference? </H3>

The reference is explained in detail in the following article.

<ul>
  <li>
    Let's master how to use <a href="/blog/20100930127859.html">reference</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3> Sample </h3>

This is a sample using a regular expression reference.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

You can use # qr // to save the options as well.
# (The g option cannot be specified.)
my $word = "ababab";
my $regex = qr/A/i;
                    
my $replace = 'c';

$word =~ s/$regex/$replace/g;
print "\$word = $word\n";
</pre>

Execution result.

<pre>
$word = cbcbcb
</pre>
