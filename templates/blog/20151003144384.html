<h2> Let's do simple calculations | Introduction to Rstats (statistical analysis/scientific calculation) </h2>

Let's do a simple calculation. Rstats can be calculated using the following operators.

<h3> Four arithmetic operations </h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      symbol
    </td>
    <td>
      meaning
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      +
    </td>
    <td>
      addition
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      - -
    </td>
    <td>
      subtraction
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      *
    </td>
    <td>
      multiplication
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
/    </td>
    <td>
      division
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

The symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are the same as in R language.

<h3> Exponentiation </h3>

Exponentiation is done using "**" according to Perl's arithmetic rules. Please note that it is different from "^" in R language.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      symbol
    </td>
    <td>
      meaning
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      ** **
    </td>
    <td>
      Exponentiation
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<h3> Remaining </h3>

The remainder is done using "%" according to Perl's arithmetic rules. Please note that it is different from "%%" in R language.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      symbol
    </td>
    <td>
      meaning
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      %%
    </td>
    <td>
      Surplus
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<h3> Integer quotient </h3>

Rstats does not provide operators for calculating integer quotients. Please note that the R language "% /%" is not available. To find the integer quotient, use the trunc function. After performing the division, the integer part is taken out.

<pre>
r->trunc($x1/$x2)
</pre>

Here is an example of the calculation. In Rstats, the calculation using vectors is the basis, so we will create it using the c_ function. The c_ function is a function for creating a vector. Even if it is one numerical value, it is calculated as a vector with one element.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;
use Rstats;

my $x = (c_ (1) + c_ (2) - c_ (3) * c_ (4))/c_ (5) ** c_ (6);
print $x;
</pre>

This is the output result. The calculation result is output.

<pre>
[1] -0.000576
</pre>

Using c_ () at any time can be a bit annoying, but it's necessary because you're implementing the R language on top of Perl. Remember that when you do calculations in Rstats, you always use vectors to do the calculations.

For future samples, I will write from the line under "use Rstats " above for convenience, so please supplement if necessary.

Rstats provides many functions for route calculation and logarithmic calculation. For example, to calculate the route, use the "sqrt function".

<pre>
my $x = r->sqrt(c_ (2));
print $x;
</pre>

Output result.

<pre>
[1] 1.4142135623731
</pre>
