<h2> stat function-get detailed information about the file </h2>


Use the <strong> stat </strong> function to get detailed information about the file.

<pre>
my @infos = stat $file;
</pre>

The following is the information that can be obtained with stat.

<h3> Sample </h3>

This is a sample to get detailed information of a file using the stat function.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

# Get detailed information about the file stat

my $file = 'a.txt';
my @stat_inf = stat $file;

Creating a # stat commentary
my @stat_exp = (
  '0 dev filesystem device number',
  '1 ino i node number',
  '2 mode file mode',
  '3 nlink Number of hard links to this file',
  '4 uid file owner's user ID (number)',
  '5 gid file owner's group ID (number)',
  '6 rdev device identifier',
  '7 size File size (bytes)',
  '8 atime The number of seconds since the epoch that has passed since the last access',
  '9 mtime The number of seconds since the last update since the epoch',
  '10 ctime The number of seconds since the epoch that has passed since the inode was changed',
  '11 blksize Block size considered appropriate for reading and writing files',
  '12 blocks Actual number of blocks allocated',
);

if (@stat_inf) {
  for my $i (0 .. 12) {
    Output by combining the information of # stat and the explanation.
    printf("%-15s%s\n", $stat_inf[$i], $stat_exp[$i]);
  }
}
else {print "stat $file failed.\n"}
</pre>
