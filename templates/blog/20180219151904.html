<h2> Addition operator "+"-Addition of numbers </h2>



You can use the <b> addition operator "+" </b> to add <a href="/blog/20161026147748.html"> numbers</a>.

<pre>
my $num3 = $num1 + $num2;
</pre>

This is a sample that adds 3 and 5.

<pre>
my $total = 3 + 5;
</pre>

In Perl, even a small number of additions can be done without being aware of the type.

<pre>
my $total = 3.5 + 2.7;
</pre>

<h3> Numeric automatic expansion </h3>

Perl does not have a numeric type in programming languages, but it does have a numeric type internally.

If it cannot be calculated with a 32-bit integer, it will be extended to a 64-bit integer and calculated if the environment supports it.

If it cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer, it will be expanded to a double-precision floating-point type and calculated.

<h3> String concatenation is done with the string concatenation operator </h3>

In Perl, the operator "+" is used only to add numbers. If you want to concatenate strings, use <a href="/blog/20080221120361.html"> string concatenation operator "."</a>.

<pre>
my $str ='ABC'.'DEF';
</pre>

<h3> Addition of character strings can be done as it is </h3>

Perl automatically converts <a href="/blog/20161003147558.html"> strings</a> to numbers, and even strings can be added with the addition operator if they contain numbers. You can add.

<pre>
my $num_str1 = "34";
my $num_str2 = "56";

my $total = $num_str1 + $num_str2;
</pre>

Perl is extremely useful for small tasks because you can get a string containing numbers from a text file and add it as is.

<h3> Explanation of arithmetic operators </h3>

The addition operator is one of the arithmetic operators. For a detailed explanation of arithmetic operators, see the Arithmetic Operators Explanation page.
