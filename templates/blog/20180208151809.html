<h2> Hash reference </h2>



A data structure called <b> hash reference </b> frequently appears in Perl. This page details the hash reference from the <a href="/blog/20100930127859.html">Reference</a>.

<h4> What is a hash reference? </H4>

A hash reference is a reference to a <a href="/blog/20161013147635.html">hash</a>. A reference means to point. You can use the reference generator "\" on a hash to create a hash reference.

<pre>
# Create a hash reference
my %score = (math => 68, english => 90);
my $score_ref = \%score;
</pre>

Note that the hash reference is assigned to the <a href="/blog/20161107147852.html">scalar variable</a>.

Let's write an image of the hash reference below.

<pre>
# image
                      %score
$score_ref - -- -->(math => 68, english => 90)
</pre>

A hash reference represents "what points to a hash" rather than the hash itself.

<h4> Hash reference is assigned and the contents are not copied </h4>

Let's see the difference between hashes and hash references from here.

The hash is copied in its entirety by assignment, but the hash reference is not copied.

<pre>
# Hash is the value copied
my %score1 = (math => 68, english => 90);
my %score2 = %score1;

# Hash reference does not copy value
my %score1 = (math => 68, english => 90);
my $score_ref1 = \%score1;
my $score_ref2 = $score_ref1;
</pre>

Below is an image. In the case of a hash, the entire contents are copied, whereas in the hash reference, the reference itself is copied, not the contents.

<pre>
# image
%score1%score2
(math => 68, english => 90) (math => 68, english => 90)

$score_ref1 - -- -- -- ->$score_ref2 - -- -- -- ->(math => 68, english => 90)
</pre>

When passing to <a href="/blog/20101130129876.html">subroutine</a>, it is more efficient to pass a hash reference because the contents are not copied.

<pre>
# Pass the hash reference to the subroutine
my_func ($score_ref1);
</pre>

<h3> Anonymous hash generator </h3>

Hash references can be created using the reference generator "\", but this is a bit tricky. An operator called <a href="/blog/20170926150643.html">anonymous hash generator</a> is defined to quickly create a hash reference.

<pre>
my $score_ref = {math => 68, english => 90};
</pre>

Note that the hash reference is generated using the anonymous hash generator "{}", whereas the normal hash is created with "()".

This notation appears frequently in Perl source code. It is important to read from the source code whether it is a hash or a hash reference.

<pre>
# Hash
my %score = (math => 68, english => 90);

# Hash reference
my $score = {math => 68, english => 90};
</pre>

<h3> Dereference </h3>

I used a reference generator to generate a hash reference. Now let's extract the hash from the hash reference, on the contrary.

To do this, perform an operation called <b> dereference </b>.

<pre>
my $score_ref = {math => 68, english => 90};

# Dereference
my %score = %{$score_ref};
</pre>

Dereferences can be made using the notation "%{hash reference}".

If the hash reference is a scalar variable, you can omit the "{}".

<pre>
my %score = %$score_ref;
</pre>

<h4> Pass as an argument to a standard function </h4>

<a href="/blog/20080210120265.html">keys function</a>, <a href="/blog/20100222126425.html">values function</a>, <a href="/blog/20080212120283. Hash-related functions such as the html">each function</a> take a hash as an argument. So be aware that if you want to pass a hash reference, you need to dereference it.

<pre>
# Dereference and pass to standard function
keys %$hash;
values %$hash;
each %$hash;
</pre>

<h3> Extract the hash value from the hash reference </h3>

You can use the arrow operator "->" to retrieve the hash value from the hash reference.

<pre>
# Get the hash value from the hash reference
my $score_math = $score_ref->{math};

# Set the hash value from the hash reference
$score_ref->{math} = 67;
</pre>

If the arrow operator is used, it is a hash reference. If not, it's a hash. Please be able to read this well in the source code.

<pre>
# Get hash value
my $score_math = $score{math};

# Set hash value
$score{math} = 67;
</pre>

It's important to look closely, as it depends on whether it's a hash or a hash reference, with or without the arrow operator.

<h4> Array reference </h4>

Array references are as often used as hash references.

<pre>
my $nums_ref = [1, 3, 5];
</pre>

Array references are described in detail below.
