Perl Banjo (PerlBanjo.com) allows you to run Perl programs right away.

You can run and share the Perl source code by writing the Perl source code in the text area and pressing "Save for 30 days & amp; run".

You can give command line arguments.

The interface is simple, it runs fast, and the results are returned in about 5 seconds.

It seems that you can modify the source code written by other people a little, execute it, save it, and share it.

You can run Perl right away from the Web, so you can use it as an introduction to "write Perl this way."
