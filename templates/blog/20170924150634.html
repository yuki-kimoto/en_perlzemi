<h2>Anonymous array generator [] - Easily create array reference</h2>



Perl has an operator <b> anonymous array generator </b> "[]". The name is a bit tricky, but in practice it's an easy way to create an array reference.

With the anonymous array generator, you can easily create a <a href="/blog/20180214151861.html">array reference</a> as follows:

<pre>
# Anonymous array generator
my $nums = [1, 2, 3];
</pre>

If you don't want to use an anonymous array generator, write:First create a <a href="/blog/20161012147627.html">array</a> and then use the reference generator to create an array reference.

<pre>
# If you don't use an anonymous array generator
my @nums = (1, 2, 3);
my $nums = \@nums;
</pre>

If you use an anonymous array generator, you can omit the above process and write it. When you look at [1, 2, 3], it will be easier to understand if you have the feeling that the above processing is omitted.

<b> Why is it called an "anonymous array generator"? </B>

With the anonymous array generator, you don't have to create an array called "@nums". In other words, an "anonymous array" corresponding to "@nums" is created internally.

I'm sure it was named with a focus on this part.

There is a <a href="/blog/20170926150643.html">anonymous hash generator</a> that corresponds to the anonymous array generator.
