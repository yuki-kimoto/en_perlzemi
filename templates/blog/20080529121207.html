<h2> glob function - get list of files contained in directory </h2>



You can use the <strong> glob </strong> function to get a list of files.

<pre>
my @all_files = glob "*";
</pre>

Use the glob operator to get a list of files. The target is files (including directories) in the current directory. When you get the file list of another directory, move the current directory with <a href="/blog/20080528121197.html">chdir function</a>, or express it with a relative path or an absolute path. ..

<h3> Example of glob argument expression </h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      "*"
    </td>
    <td>
      All files that do not start with.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      "*.TXT"
    </td>
    <td>
      Files ending in .txt
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      "* .txt * .pl
    </td>
    <td>
      .txt or a file ending in .pl (there is a space between .txt and .pl)
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      "*. *"
    </td>
    <td>
      All files (with spaces between * and. *)
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      "lib/*
    </td>
    <td>
      Files under the lib directory
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      c:/dir/*
    </td>
    <td>
      Specified by absolute path
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

You can specify multiple patterns by separating them with a blank. In addition to relative paths, you can also use absolute paths. * Is one of the wildcards used in the Unix shell. The glob function expands filenames containing * according to shell wildcard expansion rules.

<h3> Sample </h3>

This is a sample glob function.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

# Get the list of files in the current directory.
# glob

print "1: Get the list of files in the current directory.\n";
# * Represents all files that do not start with.
my @all_files = glob "*";
print join("\n", @all_files). "\n\n";

print "2: Get a list of files ending in .txt.\n";
my @text_files = glob "* .txt";
print join("\n", @text_files). "\n\n";

print "3: Get a list of files ending in .txt and .pl.\n";
# If there are multiple patterns, separate them with a blank
my @text_and_pl_files = glob "* .txt * .pl";
print join("\n", @text_and_pl_files). "\n\n";

print "4: Get a list of regular files.\n";
my @normal_files = glob "*";
# If you want to do complicated things, use "*"
# Get all the files and then
Sort by # grep.
@normal_files = grep {-f $_} @normal_files;
print join("\n", @normal_files). "\n\n";
</pre>

<h3> Use the directory handle because the glob function doesn't work properly on Windows </h3>

I think you often use the glob function to get a list of files. But for now, it's best to see that the glob function doesn't work properly on Windows. If the directory name contains a specific character string, the file list cannot be obtained correctly.

So, instead of using the glob function, it's a good idea to create a function that gets a list of filenames like this: <a href="/blog/20171002150691.html">opendir function</a> to open the directory handle, <a href="/blog/20171003150703.html">readdir function</a> to read the directory Use>.

<pre>
sub get_files {
  my $dir = shift;
  
  opendir my $dh, $dir
    or die qq/Can't open directory "$dir": $!/;
  
  my @dirs = map {"$dir/$_"} grep {$_ ne '.' && $_ ne ' ..'} readdir $dh;
  
  return @dirs;
}
</pre>

How to use

<pre>
my @files = get_files ('c:/pictures');
</pre>
