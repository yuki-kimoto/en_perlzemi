<h2> Install Strawberry Perl on Windows </h2>

Strawberry Perl is one of the commercially available Perl distributions created to take advantage of Perl on Windows. Strawberry Perl is easy to install and comes with a C language compiler "MinGW", a CPAN module installer "cpanm", and a C library that is often used for image processing.

<a href="http://strawberryperl.com"> Strawberry Perl for Windows </a>

Strawbery Perl can be downloaded without membership registration. Older versions of Perl are also available for download.

<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW"> MinGW </a> is available at <a href="https://linux.perlzemi.com/"> Linux </a> The standard <a href="https://linux.perlzemi.com/blog/20201216103956.html"> gcc </a> <a href="https://c.perlzemi.com/" A Windows port of the "> C language </a> compiler. You can also use gmake, which is a port of GNU make to Windows, with Strawberry Perl. With gcc and gmake, many modules written in C / C ++ published on <a href="/blog/20101008127859.html"> CPAN </a> can be installed on Windows.

The CPAN module installer <a href="/blog/20101027127859.html"> cpanm </a> allows you to quickly and easily install CPAN modules with commands. By defining cpanfile, you can define the required modules.

<h4> Download Strawberry Perl </h4>

Assuming Windows 10, we will explain how to download and install it. The procedure is almost the same for older versions of Windows.

Download and install Strawberry Perl. The latest Perl for 2021 is Perl 5.32.

Click <b> Strawberry Perl 5.32 64bit MSI installer </b> from the link below to download Strawberry Perl to your desktop.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/releases.html"> Strawberry Perl Releases </a>
  </li>
</ul>

<a href="http://strawberryperl.com/releases.html"> <img style = "border: 1px solid #ddd" src = "/ images / strawberry_perl / strawberry_perl_msi.png"> </a>

MSI installer means the default installer for Windows.

The version number at the end may be a little different, but don't worry.

In most cases, the 64-bit version of Windows will work, but if you need the 32-bit version, download the 32-bit version of Strawberry Perl.

<h4> Install Strawberry Perl </h4>

Double-click the downloaded Strawberry Perl.

The installer will start. It may take some time to calculate the free space, but let's just wait.

The installer will start, so press "Next" to proceed.

A check box that says "I accept the terms in the License Agreement" will appear on the way. Check it and press "Next".

Press "Next" to proceed, and finally click "Install" to start installing Strawberry Perl.

You'll see a dialog here, "Do you want to allow apps from this unknown publisher to make changes to your device?", Click "Yes".

It will take about 5 minutes, so let's wait.

When the progress bar is full, the Strawberry Perl installation is complete.

Press "Finish" to close the dialog. A Readme will be displayed, but you can close it as well.

<h4> Demonstration video </h4>

<h4> Make sure Perl is installed </h4>

After the installation is complete, let's check if Strawberry Perl is actually installed.

Try running a tool called Command Prompt to see the version of Perl.

The command prompt can be executed from "Start Menu"-> "List of Apps"-> "Windows System Tools"-> "Command Prompt".

A black screen will appear, so try pressing "Enter" from the keyboard with the following characters.

<pre>
perl -v
</pre>

If the version information is displayed as shown below, the installation is successful.

<pre>
This is perl 5, version 32, subversion 0 (v5.32.1) built for MSWin32-x64-multi-thread
</pre>

This completes the Strawberry Perl installation.

To run Perl on Windows, use what is called a command prompt. You will be able to run Perl scripts using the perl command.

If you want to get started with Perl in Strawberry Perl, learn how to use the command prompt.

If you want to know how to use the command prompt, see the article "Introduction to Command Prompt for Running Perl".

<h3> Strawberry Perl doesn't work </h3>

Troubleshooting if Strawberry Perl doesn't work.

<h4> PATH environment variable priority </h4>

If another Perl such as Active Perl or Strawberry Perl 32bit is installed, the installed Strawberry Perl may not work due to the priority problem of the PATH environment variable.

In the PATH environment variable setting, move the path of the installed Strawberry Perl perl to the front, or if you are not using it, try uninstalling the conflicting Perl.
