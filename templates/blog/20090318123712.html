<h2> Play with the created objects </h2>



Let's play with the created object.

<h3> 1. Play with objects </h3>

First, let's create a $book object like this. Where it says to play around here, write various things and play.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

my $book = Book->new;

#
# Play around here.
#

package Book;
sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = {};
    return bless $self, $class;
}
</pre>

<h3> 2. Objects are data! </H3>

Let's make sure that the <b> object is data </b>.

<pre>
$book->{title} = 'Good news';
$book->{author} = 'Takeshi';
</pre>

You can see that you can set the value in the same way as a normal <b> hash reference </b>.

<pre>
print $book->{title};
</pre>

Then, the set contents will be output.

<h3> 3. Objects are tied to a class! </H3>

Let's make sure that the object is tied to a class. To see the class association

<pre>
ref
</pre>

Use a function.

<pre>
print ref $book;
</pre>

Let's try.

<pre>
Book
</pre>

You can see that it is output. Yes, you can use the <b> ref function </b> to find out which class the object is associated with.
