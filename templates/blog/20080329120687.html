<h2> next statement-jumps to the beginning of the next iteration </h2>



You can use the <strong> next statement </strong> to jump to the beginning of the next iteration. This corresponds to the continue statement in C or Java.

<pre>
next
</pre>

The next statement can be used in repetitive statements such as <a href="/blog/20100123126425.html">while statement</a> and for statements.

<pre>
while (1) {
  if (condition) {
    next; next;
  }
}

for (my $i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
  if (condition) {
    next; next;
  }
}

foreach my $animal (@animals) {
  if (condition) {
    next; next;
  }
}
</pre>

You can use the next statement when you want to skip the process only under specific conditions.

<h3> Sample program </h3>

This is a sample program that uses the next statement.

<h4> Jump to the beginning of the loop when a specific character is matched </h4>

In the middle of loop processing, you can use the next statement when you want to jump to the beginning of the next loop under certain conditions.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

my @chars = qw (z z a b c d e f);

for my $char (@chars) {
  next if $char eq 'z';
  print "$char\n";
}
</pre>

This is the execution result. Only when it is "z", it jumps to the beginning of the next loop, so the following <a href="/blog/20170404149131.html">print function</a> is not executed.

<pre>
a
b b
c
d
e
f
</pre>

"Qw (z z a b c d e f)" is a <a href="/blog/20080222120369.html">string list operator</a>.

The if statement, for statement, and while statement are explained in detail below, so please refer to them.

</ul>

<h3> Try using it with a regular expression </h3>

I often combine next with regular expressions. Let's write one sample. Let's write a sample that skips the output if it doesn't contain the string "ABC". The unless statement is used for condition judgment.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

my @strings = ('ABC', 'ABCD', 'CDE', 'FGH');

for my $string (@strings) {
  next unless $string =~ /ABC/;
  print "$string\n";
}
</pre>

This is the output result. Only those that include "ABC" are output.

<pre>
ABC
ABCD
</pre>

<h4> You can escape the loop using the last statement </h4>

Similar to the next statement is the last statement. You can break out of the loop with the last statement.

<pre>
last
</pre>

For the last statement, refer to the following article.
