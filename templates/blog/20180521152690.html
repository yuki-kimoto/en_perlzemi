<h2> Read the entire contents of the file </h2>

How can I read the contents of a file in bulk with Perl? By convention, the contents of a file are often read at once, with the following description:

<pre>
my $ file ='a.txt';
open my $ fh,'<', $ file
  or die "Can't open $ file: $!";

# Read the contents of the file at once
my $ content = do {local $ /; <$ fh>};
</pre>

The <a href="/blog/20090208123289.html"> do block </a> returns the last evaluated value.

local undefined the <a href="/blog/20161102147817.html"> special variable </a> "$ /" that represents a line break in the file.

This causes the <a href="/blog/20080722121673.html"> file input operator </a> "<$ fh>" to return the contents of the entire file.

And when the scope ends, "$ /" returns to its original state.

Keep in mind that Perl, which doesn't have a standard function to read a file at once, may read the entire contents of the file in this way.
