<h2>Windows Command Prompt Tutorial</h2>

Explains how to use Windows Command Prompt to run Perl. Command Prompt is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a> tool to run programs on Windows.

<h3>Execution of Command Prompt</h3>

Let's execute Command Prompt.

"Start Menu" | "Apps" | "Windows System Tools" | "Command Prompt"

Your home directory is shown on Command Prompt.

<pre>
C:\Users\kimot
</pre>

<h3>Showing File Extensions</h3>

The extension of Perl program is "<b>.pl</b>". It is useful if extensions of files are displayed.

The way to show file extensions is described in the following page.

<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/205086/beginner-how-to-make-windows-show-file-extensions/">How to Make Windows Show File Extensions</a>

<h3>Execution of Notepad</h3>

Perl programs are text files. You can create your Perl programs using Notepad.

The way to use Notepad is described in the following page.

<a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/start-notepad-windows/">11 ways to start Notepad in Windows</a>

<h3>Creating Perl Programs</h3>

Let's create a Perl program.

Create a file named "start.pl" at your home directory.

<pre>
C:\Users\kimot\start.pl
</pre>

And write the following text.

<pre>
print "Hello World";
</pre>

And save it.

<h3>Runing Perl Programs</h3>

Use the perl command to run Perl. Enter the following at Command Prompt and enter Enter.

<pre>
perl start.pl
</pre>

If the output is as follows, the Perl program can be executed. Congratulations.

<pre>
Hello World
</pre>

<h3>First command to remember</h3>

You can display a list of files with the dir command. Type dir and press Enter.

<pre>
dir
</pre>

You can change the working directory with the cd command.

<pre>
cd directory name
</pre>

Use cd .. to move up one directory.

<pre>
cd ..
</pre>

<h3>Pass an argument with a blank</h3>

<pre>
perl start.pl "a i u"
</pre>

If the argument contains spaces, enclose it in double quotes.

<h3>Change drive</h3>

<pre>
c:
d:
</pre>

You can change the drive to C drive with c: and to D drive with d :.

<h3>Refer to command history</h3>

<pre>
↑
↓
</pre>

You can follow the command history with the up and down keys.

<h3>Completing the file name</h3>

<pre>
Ctrl + f
</pre>

You can enter the file name halfway and press Ctrl + f to complete the file name. It is necessary to change Command Prompt settings described below.

<h3>Display environment variable</h3>

<pre>
echo %PATH% (when looking at the contents of the environment variable PATH)
</pre>

To see the environment variable, use echo %environment variable name%.

<h3>Set environment variable</h3>

<pre>
SET DATE = 20080604 (when setting the environment variable DATE to 20080604)
perl start.pl %DATE% (Example using environment variable as arguments)
</pre>

You can set environment variable with SET environment variable name = value. There should be no space to the left or right of =. To use an environment variable, use%environment variable name%.

Setting environment variable does not change the value of OS environment variable. It is valid only within Command Prompt that is running.

<h3>Convenient Command Prompt settings</h3>

<b> How to change Command Prompt settings </b>

After creating the shortcut on the desktop, you can change the setting by right-clicking "Properties".

<b> Working folder settings and file name completion settings </b>

You can set the working folder and file name completion from the "Shortcut" tab. The working folder is the current directory when the shortcut is started.

To set filename completion, add:/f on to the end of Command Prompt path labeled "link destination". There must be a space before the :. This will enable the "8. Complete Filename" command.

Example%SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe: /f on

<b> Easy edit mode setting </b>

You can set the simple edit mode from the "Options" tab. If you check it, you can copy and paste by right-clicking.

<b> Font size setting </b>

You can set the font size from the Font tab. I think it's easier to see if you make it a little smaller.

<b> Screen buffer size setting </b>

You can set the screen buffer size from the "Layout" tab. Set the "Height" item to the maximum value.

If you increase the screen buffer size "height", you can save the output for the set number of lines even if the screen scrolls.
