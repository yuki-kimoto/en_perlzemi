<h2> Escape sequence of double quoted strings </h2>

Here are the escape sequences that can be used in double-quoted strings.

<h3> Escape sequence corresponding to ASCII code </h3>

Frequently used ones are line breaks "\n" and tabs "\t".

<table>
  <tr> <th> Escape <br> Sequence </th> <th> Code <br> Point <br> Decimal </th> <th> Code <br> Point <br> Hexadecimal </th> < th> ASCII </th> <th> meaning </th> </tr>
  <tr> <td>\a </td> <td> 7 </td> <td> 07 </td> <td> BEL </td> <td> Alarm or Bell </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>\b </td> <td> 8 </td> <td> 08 </td> <td> BS </td> <td> Backspace </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>\e </td> <td> 27 </td> <td> 1B </td> <td> ESC </td> <td> Escape Sequence </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>\f </td> <td> 12 </td> <td> 0C </td> <td> FF </td> <td> form feed </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>\n </td> <td> 10 </td> <td> 0A </td> <td> LF </td> <td> Line feed </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>\r </td> <td> 13 </td> <td> 0D </td> <td> CR </td> <td> Carriage return </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>\t </td> <td> 9 </td> <td> 09 </td> <td> TAB </td> <td> Tab </td> </tr>
</table>

This is a sample using the escape sequence of tabs and line breaks.

<pre>
# Use tabs and line breaks
my $line = "ID\tName\tPrice\n";
</pre>

<h3> Occasional escape sequences </h3>

I also sometimes use escape sequences that represent double quotes "\" "and backslashes themselves" \\ ".

<table>
  <tr> <th> Escape <br> Sequence </th> <th> Meaning </th> </tr>
  <tr> <td>\"</td> <td>" </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> \\ </td> <td>\</td> </tr>
</table>

<h3> Notes on line break "\n" </h3>

There is one caveat regarding line breaks "\n".

In the source code of the program, "\n" is a single character and represents "LF" in ASCII code and "0A" in hexadecimal. This matches the Linx/Unix line feed code.

One thing to keep in mind is that Perl's I/O layer automatically converts to OS line feed code when outputting to standard output or files.

"\n" is converted to a two-character line feed code "0D 0A" on Windows. On Unix/Linux/macOS, it is "0A" without conversion.

<pre>
# "0D 0A" on Windows, "0A" on Unix/Linux/Mac
print "Hello\n";
</pre>

To avoid this conversion, use escape sequences that directly specify the ASCII code. How to specify the ASCII code directly is explained below.

<h3> Escape sequence that directly describes ASCII code </h3>
 
There are also escape sequences that allow you to write the ASCII code itself in hexadecimal by starting with "\ x".

<pre>
# Specify ASCII code directly in hexadecimal to represent HTTP protocol line breaks
my $message = "Hello\x0D\x0A";
print $message;
</pre>

The above example is a sample that expresses the line feed code in the HTTP protocol because it is an ASCII hexadecimal sequence of "D" and "A". The 0 after the "\ x" is not required, but it is included according to the convention of representing ASCII codes in 2-digit hexadecimal numbers.

<h3> Document with all escape sequences </h3>

Below is the Perl documentation with all the escape sequences.

<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://perldoc.jp/docs/perl/5.10.1/perlrebackslash.pod">perlrebackslash - Perl regular expression reverse slash sequence and escape - perldoc.jp</a> </li >
</ul>

Although it covers all the escape sequences of regular expressions, the escape sequences of double-quoted strings are included in the escape sequences of regular expressions, so let's refer only to the escape sequences of the part related to double-quoted strings.
