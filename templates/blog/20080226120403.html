<h2>chomp function - remove a line break</h2>

You can use the <strong> chomp function </strong> to remove a line break at the end of the line.

<pre>
# Remove a line break at the end of the line
chomp $line;
</pre>

<h4>Remove a line break independent of OS</h4>

Note that chomp is OS dependent. For example, when running on Windows, the trailing "\x0D\x0A" is removed, but when running on a Unix-like OS, "\x0A" is removed. \x0D is a escape sequence for carriage return and \x0A is a escape sequence for line feed. On Windows, the line break character is represented by "\x0D\x0A", and on Unix it is represented by "\x0A". This is the value of <a href="/blog/20161102147817.html">predefined variable $/</a> which depends on OS.

For this reason, if the Perl program is saved on Windows and the program is moved to Linux. A line break may not be removed correctly. If you want to remove a line break independent of the OS, use <a href="/blog/20100827127859.html">regular expression</a> as follows.

<pre>
# Remove a line break at the end of the line independent of OS
$string =~ s/\x0D?\x0A?$//;
</pre>

<h3>Example</h3>

This is an example using the chomp function.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

my $message = "I like a cake.\n";

# Remove a line break at the end of the line
chomp($message);
print $message;
</pre>
