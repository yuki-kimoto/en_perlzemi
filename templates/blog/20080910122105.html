<h2> Perl arithmetic operators </h2>



Describes the <strong> arithmetic operators </strong> for performing four arithmetic operations in Perl.

<h4> Addition </h4>

Use the <a href="/blog/20180219151904.html"> addition operator "+" </a> to add.

<pre>
# Addition
my $ add = 1 + 1;
</pre>

<h4> Subtraction </h4>

Use the <a href="/blog/20180220151913.html"> subtraction operator "-" </a> to do the subtraction.

<pre>
# Subtraction
my $ sub = 9 --1;
</pre>

<h4> Multiplication </h4>

To do the multiplication, use the <a href="/blog/20180221151922.html"> multiplication operator "*" </a>.

<pre>
#Multiplication
my $ multi = 5 * 4;
</pre>

<h4> Division </h4>

Use the <a href="/blog/20180222151930.html"> division operator "/" </a> to perform the division.

<pre>
#Division
my $ div = 9/4;
</pre>

The answer to division is a decimal if it is not divisible.

<h3> Four rules of operation with a simple description </h3>

If you want to perform 4 rules on yourself, there is a simple description method.

<pre>
Same as # $ add = $ add + 3
$ add + = 3;

Same as # $ sub = $ sub -5
$ sub-= 5;

Same as # $ multi = $ multi * 2
$ multi * = 2;

Same as # $ div = $ div / 7
$ div / = 7;
</pre>

<h3> Seeking quotient and remainder </h3>

There is no operator to find the quotient. After dividing with the / operator, the int function retrieves the integer part.

<pre>
#Quotient
my $ div_int = int (9/4);
</pre>

To find the remainder, use the <a href="/blog/20180223151939.html"> modulo operator </a>.

<pre>
#Remainder
my $ mod = 9% 4;
</pre>

<h3> Find exponentiation </h3>

Use the <strong> ** </strong> operator to find the power.

<pre>
my $ two_power_num = 4 ** 2;
</pre>

Use the <a href="/blog/20080629121475.html"> exponentiation operator "**" </a> to find the exponentiation. Exponentiation is an operation that multiplies the same number multiple times.

<h3> Increment and decrement operators </h3>

<a href="/blog/20180224151948.html"> Increment Operator </a> and <a href="/blog/20180226151973.html" for operations that add or subtract 1 to a number. You can use the> decrement operator </a>. A special description is provided. You can add 1 to the description ++ $ i or ++ $ i, and subtract 1 from the description --$ i or $ i--.

<pre>
# Increment
$ num ++;

#Decrement
$ num--;
</pre>

There are two ways to write increments and decrements, depending on whether you put ++ or-before or after the variable. Note that the meaning changes depending on the context, depending on whether the operator is added before or after the variable.

<pre>
my $ i = 0;
my $ k = ++ $ i;
</pre>

<pre>
my $ i = 0;
my $ k = $ i ++;
</pre>

The above two have different values ​​in $ k. In the first case, $ k contains 1. In the second case, $ k will be 0.

If you put ++ before, $ i is added 1 before the assignment, and if you put ++ after it, 1 is added to $ i after the assignment.

I explained in the case of assignment, but I will also give an example of passing a value to a function.

<pre>
The argument of # func is $ i plus one.
func (++ $ i);

$ I is passed to the argument of # func, and then 1 is added.
func ($ i ++);
</pre>

<h3> Numeric automatic expansion </h3>

Perl does not have a numeric type in programming languages, but it does have a numeric type internally.

If it cannot be calculated with a 32-bit integer, it will be extended to a 64-bit integer and calculated if the environment supports it.

If it cannot be represented by a 64-bit integer, it will be expanded to a double-precision floating-point type and calculated.

<h3> Addition of character strings can be done as it is </h3>

Perl automatically converts <a href="/blog/20161003147558.html"> strings </a> to numbers, and even strings can be added with the addition operator if they contain numbers. You can add.

<pre>
my $ num_str1 = "34";
my $ num_str2 = "56";

my $ total = $ num_str1 + $ num_str2;
</pre>

Perl is extremely useful for small tasks because you can get a string containing numbers from a text file and add it as is.

<h3> Sample program </h3>

This is a sample program for numerical calculation.

<h4> Four arithmetic operations </h4>

Samples of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

print "(1) 4 rules operation \ n";

# Addition
my $ add = 1 + 1;

# Subtraction
my $ sub = 9 --1;

#Multiplication
my $ multi = 5 * 4;

#Division
my $ div = 9/4;

print "\ $ add = $ add \ n";
print "\ $ sub = $ sub \ n";
print "\ $ multi = $ multi \ n";
print "\ $ div = $ div \ n \ n";

print "(2) Four-rule operation with a simple description \ n";

Same as # $ add = $ add + 3
$ add + = 3;

Same as # $ sub = $ sub -5
$ sub-= 5;

Same as # $ multi = $ multi * 2
$ multi * = 2;

Same as # $ div = $ div / 7
$ div / = 7;

print "\ $ add = $ add \ n";
print "\ $ sub = $ sub \ n";
print "\ $ multi = $ multi \ n";
print "\ $ div = $ div \ n \ n";


print "(3) Operation to find quotient and remainder \ n";
#Quotient
my $ div_int = int (9/4);
#Remainder
my $ mod = 9% 4;

print "\ $ div_int = $ div_int \ n";
print "\ $ mod = $ mod \ n";
</pre>

<h4> Find exponentiation </h4>

This is a sample to find the power.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

# Find a power.
print "1: Find the power. \ N";
my $ num = 4;
my $ two_power_num = 4 ** 2;
print "The square of $ num is $ two_power_num. \ N";
</pre>

<h4> Increment and decrement </h4>

This is a sample using the increment operator and the decrement operator.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

# 1 is added before being evaluated.
print "(1) Prefix increment and decrement \ n";
my $ i = 0;
print ++ $ i. "\ n";
print $ i. "\ n";

print-$ i. "\ n";
print $ i. "\ n";

# 1 is added after being evaluated.
print "(2) Post-increment and decrement \ n";
$ i = 0;
print $ i ++. "\ n";
print $ i. "\ n";

print $ i--. "\ n";
print $ i;
</pre>
