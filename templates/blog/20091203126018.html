<h2> Install SQLite on Windows </h2>

As you get used to it, you'll want to run and experiment with different types of SQL. For that purpose, it is convenient to have an environment where SQL can be executed interactively. This time, let's create an environment for executing SQL on Windows.

<h3> Download libraries and command line programs </h3>

To use SQLite, you need a library to operate the database and a command line program to execute SQL. You need to get these two.

<h4> SQLite home page </h4>

The following is the SQLite home page.

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/"> SQLite site </a>
</blockquote>

<h4> SQLite download page </h4>

There is a link that says "Download" in the middle of the top of the homepage. Here is a link to the SQLite download page.

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/download.html"> SQLite Download Page </a>
</blockquote>

<h4> Find SQLite libraries and command line programs for Windows </h4>

Go around the page looking for Windows-like SQLite libraries and command line programs. I think it says something like "For Windows". "Sqlite dll ~ .zip" is the SQLite library. "Sqlite ~ .zip" is a SQLite command line program. Let's download these two.

I will link to the latest version as of December 07, 2009.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/sqlitedll-3_6_20.zip"> sqlitedll-3_6_20.zip </a> (SQLite library)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-3_6_20.zip"> sqlite-3_6_20.zip </a> (SQLite command line program)
  </li>
</ul>

Download these and unzip the zip file.

<h3> File placement </h3>

When you unzip the file, you will find "sqlitedll ~ .zip"

<blockquote>
sqlite3.def
sqlite3.dll
</blockquote>

File is
In "sqlite ï½ž .zip"

<blockquote>
sqlite3.exe
</blockquote>

I think that the file is included. sqlite3.def is needed to create a static library, so I don't need it now.

<blockquote>
sqlite3.dll
sqlite3.exe
</blockquote>

Place the file in your favorite directory. This time

<blockquote>
c: \ sqlite
</blockquote>

I will place it in the directory called.

<h3> Setting the environment variable Path </h3>

<h4> Find the environment variable Path </h4>
Next, set the environment variable Path so that "sqlite3.exe" can be executed from the command prompt. Be careful when setting this path. I'm going to change the value of the environment variable Path, but if I make a mistake, there is a risk that it will not work properly. Make sure to copy the Path value and save it somewhere.

First, right-click on "My Computer" and click "Properties" in the pop-up menu. Then there is a tab called "Detailed Settings" at the top, so click on it. At the bottom of the "Advanced" tab, you'll see a button called "Environment Variables". Please click this.

When the "Environment Variables" window opens, look for the item "Path" in the "System Variables" list at the bottom.

<h4> Setting the environment variable Path </h4>

Click on the item called Path and press the "Edit" button at the bottom right. Then you can edit the value of Path, so first copy it and save it somewhere in a text file. It is safe because it can be restored.

When you're done, put the environment variable Path at the beginning

<blockquote>
c: \ sqlite; (value of the original environment variable Path)
</blockquote>

Please add. Notice that there is a semicolon after "c: \ sqlite". Once set, press OK several times to close the properties.

<h3> Confirm that the SQLite command line program can be executed </h3>

Now start the command prompt

<blockquote>
sqlite3
</blockquote>

Let's try. The environment variable settings will be reflected when the command prompt is restarted, so if it has already started, restart the command prompt.

If you can execute sqlite3 as shown below, you have successfully installed it.

<blockquote>
SQLite version 3.6.20
Enter ".help" for instructions
Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
sqlite>
</blockquote>

If you want to quit

<blockquote>
.quit
</blockquote>

will do.

Now you have an environment where you can execute SQL interactively.
