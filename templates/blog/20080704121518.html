<h2> Subroutine reference </h2>



A subroutine reference is a reference to a subroutine.

<pre>
# Create reference
my $twice_ref = \ & twice;
# Dereference and call
my $twice_num = $twice_ref->($num);
 
sub twice {
  return $_[0] * 2;
}
</pre>

Express the subroutine itself with & twice. (Similar to an array with @and a hash with%, a subroutine is represented with &.) Normally, subroutines are called like twice ($num). You can also call it explicitly, like & twice ($num).

To represent a reference to a subroutine, use \ & twice. To call the subroutine, dereference the reference to the subroutine, as in $twice_ref->(1). A description very similar to a hash or array dereference.

See the following articles for a detailed explanation of the reference.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/blog/20100930127859.html">Let's master how to use the reference</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4> Reference to anonymous subroutines </h4>

You can create a reference to an unnamed subroutine such as sub {}. Write as my $sum_ref = sub {} ;. The subroutine itself is not executed, but a reference to the subroutine is assigned to $sum_ref.

<pre>
my $sum_ref = sub {
  my @nums = @_;
  my $total;
  for my $num (@nums) {
    $total + = $num;
  }
  return $total;
};
</pre>

You can create a reference to a subroutine and pass it as an argument to the subroutine. In Perl, you can use a subroutine reference to pass a subroutine to a subroutine.

You can also use a reference to a subroutine to execute the subroutine selectively. I will see a concrete example next time.

<h3> Polymorphism using references to subroutines </h3>

This is a sample that realizes polymorphism using a reference to a subroutine.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

my @nums = (1, 2, 3);

print "1: Calculate the sum and average in order using the reference to the subroutine.\n";

Create a # array of references to # subroutines.
my @calc_funcs = (\ & sum, \ & average);
                                       
for my $calc_func (@calc_funcs) {
  my $result = $calc_func->(@nums);
  print "Result: $result\n";
}
print "\n";

sub sum {
  my @nums = @_;
  my $total;
  for my $num (@nums) {
    $total + = $num;
  }
  return $total;
}

sub average {
  return sum (@_) / @_;
}


print "2: Selectively process using reference to subroutine.\n";
my $how_to_calc ='sum';
my $calc_func;

if ($how_to_calc eq'sum') {
  $calc_func = \ & sum;
}
else {
  $calc_func = \ & average;
}

my $result = $calc_func->(@nums);

print "Calculation method: $how_to_calc\n".
  "Result: $result\n\n";


print "3: Selectively process using reference to subroutine and hash.\n";
$how_to_calc ='average';
my %calc_table = (sum => \ & sum, average => \ & average);

# $calc_table{'average'} is a reference to the subroutine
Since # is included, dereference it with the->operator.
# Call a subroutine.
$result = $calc_table{$how_to_calc}->(@nums);

print "Calculation method: $how_to_calc\n".
  "Result: $result\n\n";
</pre>

<h4> Apply subroutines to variables in sequence </h4>

<pre>
my @calc_funcs = (\ & sum, \ & average);
for my $calc_func (@calc_funcs) {
  my $result = $calc_func->(@nums);
}
</pre>

To apply subroutines in sequence to a <a href="/blog/20161107147852.html">variable</a>, use a reference to the subroutine. Store the reference to the subroutine in an array and call the subroutine repeatedly in <a href="/blog/20170521149524.html">for loop</a>.

<h4> Image of variables and subroutines </h4>

<pre>
| - -- -- -- |
| | <- -- --- Subroutine 1
| |
| Variables | <- -- --- Subroutine 2
| |
| | <- -- --- Subroutine 3
| - -- -- -- |
</pre>

An image of applying subroutines in order to a certain type of argument. The argument is fixed, and the image of the subroutine changing.

<h4> Polymorphism using references to subroutines </h4>

<pre>
How to branch with # if statement
my $how_to_calc ='sum';
my $calc_func;

if ($how_to_calc eq'sum') {
  $calc_func = \ & sum;
}
else {
  $calc_func = \ & average;
}

my $result = $calc_func->(@nums);
</pre>

Polymorphism is a term that means "the same description but different functions are called". Object-oriented often means that "different methods are applied depending on the object".

In this example, the statement $calc_func->(@num) has different meanings depending on what is assigned to $calc_func. If \ $sum is assigned, the sum subroutine is called, and if \ $average is assigned, the average subroutine is called.

In java, overloading and overriding are the ways to achieve polymorphism, and in C they are function pointers.

<h4> Beautiful method using hash </h4>

<pre>
$how_to_calc ='average';
my %calc_table = (sum => \ & sum, average => \ & average);
$result = $calc_table{$how_to_calc}->(@nums);
</pre>

I think the <a href="/blog/20161013147635.html">hash</a> method is the most sophisticated form of function-referenced polymorphism.

Although it is a selective process, it does not use any if statements. The process is branched by calling the subroutine corresponding to the hash key.

<h3> Implementation of signal handler in subroutine </h3>

A <strong> signal handler </strong> is a subroutine that is executed triggered by a signal. A signal is a signal that the OS sends to a process. Ctrl + c asks the OS to "send an INT signal to the currently running process." The alerm function also asks the OS to "send a LARM signal to the currently running process after n seconds".

<pre>
$SIG{INT} = sub {
  die "INT signal sent to this process.";
};

$SIG{ALRM} = sub {
  die "ALRM signal was sent to this process.";
};
</pre>

To catch the INT signal, assign a reference to the subroutine to $SIG{INT}. This example defines an anonymous subroutine and assigns its reference.

There are a lot of things to note about signals, but I won't write them here. I write it when I write about interprocess communication.

<h3> A rudimentary implementation of event-driven programming </h3>

This is a sample of a rudimentary implementation of event-driven programming.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

# Event handler
my $text = "aIue !!! o";

Pass the event handler as the # argument.
parse (
  $
text,
  start_h => \ & start,
  lc_h => \ & found_lc,
  end_h => \ & end,
);

# Subroutine that parses a string (event detection function)
sub parse {
  # Receives a hash of text and event handlers.
  my ($text,%handler) = @_;
  
  # First called handler
  $handler{start_h}->();
  
  # Analyze one character at a time.
  for my $i (0 .. length($text) ―― 1) {
    my $char = substr($text, $i, 1);
    
    # Call an event handler when it finds a lowercase letter.
    # Made available in callback functions
    # Pass the character and position as arguments.
    if ($char = ~ / [a-z] /) {
      $handler{lc_h}->($char, $i);
    }
  }
  
  # Last called handler
  $handler{end_h}->();
}

# Event handler (callback function)
sub start {
  print "String parsing has started.\n";
}

sub found_lc {
  # Called when a lowercase letter is found.
  
  You can receive characters and positions as # arguments.
  my ($char, $pos) = @_;
                             
  print "The position of $char is $pos.\n";
}

sub end {
  print "The parse of the string is finished.\n";
}
</pre>

(Reference) <a href="/blog/20080224120386.html">substr function</a>

<h4> (1) Subroutine for detecting events </h4>

<pre>
# Call a function to detect an event.
parse (
  $text,
  start_h => \ & start,
  lc_h => \ & found_lc,
  end_h => \ & end,
);

# Event detection function
sub parse {
  # Receives a hash of text and event handlers.
  my ($text,%handler) = @_;
  
  # First called handler
  $handler{start_h}->();
  # ...
}
</pre>

In event-driven programming, "event detection" and "event execution" are separated. To do this, first implement the process of detecting the event as a subroutine.

The argument uses a hash to pass a reference to the subroutine. This subroutine is executed when an event occurs.

<h4> (2) Subroutine (callback function) executed when an event occurs </h4>

<pre>
sub start {
  print "String parsing has started.\n";
}

sub found_lc {
  # Called when a lowercase letter is found.
  You can receive characters and positions as # arguments.

  my ($char, $pos) = @_;
                             
  print "The position of $char is $pos.\n";
}

sub end {
  print "The parse of the string is finished.\n";
}
</pre>

Subroutines that are executed when an event occurs are commonly referred to as callback functions. Here, write the processing to be performed when an event occurs.

It is a function that detects an event, and if you pass an argument when calling the callback function, it can be received and used by the callback function.

<h3> Sample code </h3>

Subroutine sample code.

<h4> Subroutine reference </h4>

This is a sample to create a reference to a subroutine.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

# Subroutine reference
# Prefix\to the subroutine
# It will be a reference.
# & twice refers to the twice subroutine itself.
print "1: Reference to subroutine\n";
my $twice_ref = \ & twice;

# When calling
# $sub_ref->(arg1, arg2)
Call it like # .
# When no argument is needed
# $sub_ref->().
my $num = 1;
my $twice_num = $twice_ref->($num);

print "Twice of $num is $twice_num.\n\n";

sub twice {
  return $_[0] * 2;
}


Assign a reference to a subroutine that does not have the name # sub {} into $sum_ref.
print "2: Reference to anonymous subroutine\n";
my $sum_ref = sub {
  my @nums = @_;
  my $total;
  for my $num (@nums) {
    $total + = $num;
  }
  return $total;
};

my $total = $sum_ref->(1, 2, 3);
print "The sum of 1,2,3 is $total.\n\n";
</pre>

<h4> Signal handler </h4>

This is a sample using a signal handler. I'm using a <a href="/blog/20100123126425.html">while statement</a> to do an infinite loop.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

print "1: Capture INT signal with signal handler.\n";

$SIG{INT} = sub {
  die "INT signal sent to this process.";
};

# infinite loop
while (1) {};

Use Ctrl + c to send a # INT signal to a running process.
</pre>

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

print "2: Capture ALRM signal with signal handler.\n";

$SIG{ALRM} = sub {
  die "ALRM signal was sent to this process.";
};

# After 2 seconds, send an ALRM signal to the running process.
alarm 2;

# infinite loop
while (1) {};
</pre>
