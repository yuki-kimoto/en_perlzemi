<h2>Read a CSV file and convert it to an array of arrays</h2>

This is an example that actually reads a CSV file, converts it to a Perl data type (array of arrays), and writes it to standard output. The conversion from csv to an array of arrays is done using subroutine. I think it will also be a basic template for reading and editing some kind of file.

CSV etc. including a line break etc. cannot be processed correctly by the following programs. If you want to process CSV correctly, <a href="https://perldoc.jp/docs/modules/Text-CSV_XS-0.23/Text-CSV_XS-0.23.pod">Text::CSV_XS</a> or There is <a href="https://perlzemi.com/blog/20110627131112.html">Text::CSV::Encoded</a>. Text::CSV::Encoded is a wrapper module of Text::CSV or Text::CSV_XS and can handle Japanese easily.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

# Argument processing
my $file = shift;

unless ($file) {
  # If there is no argument, indicate the usage and end.
  die "Usage: $0 file";
}

# Parse the file and convert the csv format data to an array of arrays.
my @recs = parse_file ($file);

# Output (because it is a two-dimensional array, follow it with for)
for my $items (@recs) {
  # Output by connecting with comma.
  print join(',', @$items) . "\n";
}

# Function for file analysis (I just write it back this time ...)
sub parse_file {
  my $file = shift;
    
  open(my $fh, "<", $file)
    or die "Cannot open $file for read:$!";
  
  # Prepare a reference to an array that stores multiple records
  my $recs = [];
  while (my $line = <$fh>) {
    chomp $line; # Remove a line break
    
    # Prepare a reference to the array that stores the data
    # Separate rows with commas and store in array
    # split returns an array, so
    # Dereference with @$items

    my $items = [];
    @$items = split(/,/, $line);

    # The first argument of the push function is an array, so @$recs
    # And dereference.
    push @$recs, $items;
  }
  close $fh;
  return $recs;
}
</pre>

Below is an example of csv data. Create a CSV file, give it to the first argument of the script, and execute it.

<pre>
masao, 10, Japan
taro, 20, USA
rika, 38, France
</pre>

<h3>Code explanation</h3>

<h4>(1) Processing when the file name is not given in the first argument</h4>

<pre>
unless ($file) {
  # If there is no argument, indicate the usage and end.
  die "Usage: $0 file";
}
</pre>

Check the arguments as much as possible. If there is no file name in the first argument, indicate the usage and exit. $0 is the name of the script running in the predefined variable.

<h4>(2) Read the file and convert the csv format text to an array of arrays</h4>

<pre>
my @recs = parse_file ($file);
</pre>

parse_file is a self-made subroutine. Read the file and convert the csv format text to an array of arrays. The input and output images are as follows.

<pre>
masao, 10, Japan
taro, 20, USA
rika, 38, France

â†“

@recs = (
    ['masao', 10, 'Japan'],
    ['taro', 20, 'USA'],
    ['rika', 38, 'France'],
)
</pre>

<h4>(3) Output in csv format</h4>

<pre>
for my $items (@recs) {
  # Output by connecting with comma.
  print join(',', @$items) . "\n";
}
</pre>

To output, repeat foreach statement for the number of records contained in @recs. Each record is concatenated with a comma with <a href="/blog/20081007122338.html">join function</a> and output. Add a line break at the end.

<h4>(4) Explanation of the function that reads a file and converts csv format text into an array of arrays</h4>

<pre>
sub parse_file {
  my $file = shift;
  
  open(my $fh, "<", $file)
    or die "Cannot open $file for read:$!";
  
  # Prepare a reference to an array that stores multiple records
  my $recs = [];
  while (my $line = <$fh>) {
    # Remove a line break
    chomp $line;
    
    # Prepare a reference to the array that stores the data
    # Separate rows with commas and store in array
    # split returns an array, so
    # Dereference with @$items
    my $items = [];
    @$items = split(/,/, $line);

    # Since the first argument of the push function is an array, dereference it with @$recs.
    push @$recs, $items;
  }
  close $fh;
  return $recs;
}
</pre>

<h4>(4) - 1 Receive file name as an argument</h4>

<pre>
my $file = shift;
</pre>

Give the file name as an argument to open and close the file in the subroutine.

<h4>(4) - 2 Creating an array of arrays to return as a return value</h4>

<pre>
my $recs = []; # Prepare a reference to an array that stores multiple records
</pre>

The final result will be as follows, but first create only the outermost frame.

<pre>
$recs = [
  ['masao', 10, 'Japan'],
  ['taro', 20, 'USA'],
  ['rika', 38, 'France'],
]
</pre>

<h4>(4) - 3 Processing in a while loop</h4>

I'm using <a href="/blog/20100123126425.html">while statement</a> to create a Perl data structure.

<pre>
while (my $line = <$fh>) {
  # Remove a line break
  chomp $line;

  # Prepare a reference to the array that stores the data
  my $items = [];

  # Separate rows with commas and store in array
  # split returns an array, so
  # Dereference with @$items
  @$items = split(/,/, $line);

  # Since the first argument of the push function is an array, dereference it with @{$recs}.
  push @$recs, $items;
}
</pre>

<h4>(4) - 3 - a Creating a reference to an empty array</h4>

<pre>
my $items = [];
</pre>

At the end of the first while loop, it will be [masao, 10, Japan], but first create only the frame.

<h4>(4) - 3 - b Comma - separated string split</h4>

<pre>
@$items = split(/,/, $line);
</pre>

The split function returns an array, so to receive it, dereference $items to @$items.

<h4>(4) - 3 - c Add the created record to the reference to the array</h4>

<pre>
push @$recs, $items;
</pre>

Add $items to $recs. When the first while is finished, it will be as follows.

<pre>
$recs = [
  ['masao', 10, 'Japan'],
]
</pre>

The first argument of push receives an array and dereference it.

<h3>Rewrote the subroutine after being pointed out by kits</h3>

<pre>
Put the data in my @recs rather than push @$recs
It's like returning @recs or \@recs at the end.
(I feel that the effort of dereference is wasted)
</pre>

The following is a rewritten subroutine. As kits said, this one is much cleaner. Thank you very much.

<pre>
sub parse_file {
  my $file = shift;
    
  open(my $fh, "<", $file)
    or die "Cannot open $file for read:$!";
    
  # Change to array
  my @recs;
  while (my $line = <$fh>) {
    # Remove a line break
chomp $line;
      
     # Change to array
     my @items;
     @items = split(/,/, $line);

     # Create a reference with [] when pushing.
     push @recs, [@items];
   }
   close $fh;
   return \@recs;
}
</pre>
