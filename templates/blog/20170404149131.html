<h2> print function-prints a string </h2>



Use the <b> print function </b> to print the string.

<pre>
print "Hello World!";
</pre>

You can also assign a string to a variable and then pass it to the print function. This method is recommended when actually writing a program. It is a method to create one character string and then pass it to the print function.

<pre>
my $message = "Hello World!";
print $message;
</pre>

You can also pass a <a href="/blog/20100308126967.html">list</a> or an array to the print function. The character strings are concatenated and output. When actually writing a program, the above method is recommended over this method.

<pre>
# List
print "Hello", "World", "!";

# arrangement
my @strings = ("Hello", "World", "!");
print @strings;
</pre>

<h3> How to output after concatenating an array into one character string </h3>

A common technique is to concatenate array strings with commas and output with a newline at the end.

This is done using the print function and the <a href="/blog/20081007122338.html">join function</a>, <a href="/blog/20080221120361.html">string concatenation operator</a> You can write beautifully.

<pre>
my @animals = ('Dog', 'Cat', 'Mouse');
print join(',', @animals) . "\n";
</pre>

<h3> The default output destination of the print function is standard output </h3>

The default output destination for the print function is the screen, or <b> standard output </b>. Please refer to the following article for a detailed explanation of standard output.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/blog/20080730121743.html">Standard input Standard output Standard error output</a>
  </li>
</ul>

The default output destination of the print function is standard output, and the following two writing styles have the same meaning.

<pre>
print "Hello";
print STDOUT "Hello";
</pre>

Note that there is no comma after STDOUT. This is called "indirect object syntax" and has the same meaning as the following notation.

<pre>
STDOUT->print("Hello");
</pre>

It is Perl's convention to use indirect object syntax when specifying the output destination in the print function.

<h3> Specify standard error output </h3>

You can specify <b> standard error output </b> as the output destination. Specify <b> STDERR </b> as the output destination.

<pre>
print STDERR "Hello";
</pre>

Standard error output is for errors. For a detailed explanation of standard error output, refer to the following article.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/blog/20080730121743.html">Standard input Standard output Standard error output</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3> Specify file handle </h3>

You can also change the output destination of the print function to a file. In that case, open the file with <a href="/blog/20080718121643.html">open function</a>, create a file handle, and specify the file handle with the print function.

<pre>
my $file = "output.txt";
open my $fh, '>', $file
  or die "Can't open \" $file\":$!";
print $fh "Hello";
</pre>

"Hello" is output to a file called "output.txt".

<h3> Same as the echo function in the shell </h3>

If you're using bash, you'd probably use echo for output, which is a feature of Perl's print function.

<h3> If you want to format it, printf function or sprintf function </h3>

If you want to specify the format like the C language printf function, use <a href="/blog/20170326149148.html">printf function</a> or <a href="/blog/20081001122296.html" Create a string formatted with the> sprintf function</a> and pass it to the print function.

<pre>
# printf function
printf "Number%d", 3;

# sprintf function
my $string = sprintf("Number%d", 3);
print $string;
</pre>

<h3> Technique to output to a file by redirect </h3>

A common technique is to redirect standard output to a file. This technique allows you to output to a file without using the open function.

First, write the print function normally.

<pre>
# hello.pl
print "Hello";
</pre>

Then use redirect to output to a file. Execute the command as follows.

<pre>
perl hello.pl > output.txt
</pre>

"Hello" is output to a file called "output.txt".
