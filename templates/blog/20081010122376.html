<h2> gmtime function-gets the current date and time(Coordinated Universal Time) </h2>



Use the <strong> gmtime function </strong> to get the current date and time in Coordinated Universal Time. It's called gmtime, but it's now a function that gets Coordinated Universal Time, not a function that gets Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

<pre>
# Seconds Minutes Hours Day Months Years of the week Beginning of the year or daylight saving time
Apply # et al.
# Elapsed days
my ($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year, $wday, $yday, $isdst) = gmtime;

# Time string
my $localtime = gmtime;
</pre>

If you want to get the local time, use <a href="/blog/20081009122357.html">localtime function</a>.

If you only need to know the elapsed time since the epoch, use the <a href="/blog/20081008122347.html">time function</a>.

<a href="/blog/20091105124627.html">Time::Piece</a> is also recommended if you want to handle the date and time more conveniently.

For general information about dates and times, please refer to the following.

<h3> gmtime function sample </h3>

This is a sample of the gmtime function.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

print "(1) Get the current date and time(Coordinated Universal Time).\n";
# Seconds Minutes Hours Day Months Years of the week Beginning of the year or daylight saving time
Apply # et al.
# Elapsed days
my ($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year, $wday, $yday, $isdst) = gmtime;

The # localtime function returns the year counted from 1900.
$year += 1900;

# Month starts from 0, so add 1 to display it.
$mon ++;

# Sunday will be 0.
my @day_of_week = qw/Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat/;

print "Currently $year year $mon month $mday day $hour hour $min minute $sec second.";
print "Day of the week". $Day_of_week[$wday]. "Day of the week.\n\n";
print "$yday days have passed counting in one year.\n\n";

if ($isdst) {
  print "Currently daylight saving time is applied.\n\n";
}
else {
  print "Currently daylight saving time does not apply.\n\n";
}

print "(2) Get the current date (Coordinated Universal Time) as a string.\n";
my $date_str = gmtime;
print $date_str . "\n";
