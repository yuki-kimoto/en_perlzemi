<h2>DBD::ODBC error install_driver (ODBC) failed: Unable to get DBI state function. DBI not loaded</h2>
The following error occurred in DBD::ODBC when migrating the environment.

<blockquote>
install_driver (ODBC) failed: Unable to get DBI state function. DBI not loaded
</blockquote>

This seems to be because the DBD function could not be found because the DBI version is old, and it was fixed when both DBI and DBD::ODBC were upgraded.
