<h2>Selenium::Chrome - JavaScript - enabled web scraping using Chrome</h2>

Selenium::Chrome allows you to use Chrome for JavaScript-enabled web scraping. Selenium::Chrome is an extension of <a href="/blog/20210105145700.html">Selenium::Remote::Driver</a> for Chrome. You can use it by installing Selenium::Remote::Driver.

<h4>When running on Windows, Mac</h4>

<pre>
# When running on Windows, Mac
use Selenium::Chrome;
my $driver = Selenium::Chrome->new;
$driver->get('http://www.google.com');
print $driver->get_title();
$driver->shutdown_binary();
</pre>

<h4>When executing headless when there is no GUI screen such as Unix/Linux</h4>

If you want to execute on the CUI screen when there is no GUI environment, execute headless as follows.

<pre>
# When executing headless when there is no GUI screen such as Unix/Linux
use Selenium::Chrome;
my $driver = Selenium::Chrome->new(
  extra_capabilities => {
    'goog: chromeOptions' => {
      args => ['headless', 'disable-gpu', 'window-size = 1920,1080', 'no-sandbox']
    }
  }
);
$driver->get('http://www.google.com');
print $driver->get_title();
$driver->shutdown_binary();
</pre>

If the following error occurs, please execute headless with the above option.

<blockquote>
Could not create new session: unknown error: Chrome failed to start: exited abnormally.
  (unknown error: DevToolsActivePort file doesn't exist)
  (The process started from chrome location/usr/bin/google-chrome is no longer running, so ChromeDriver is assuming that Chrome has crashed.) At access.pl line 79.
</blockquote>

<h3>Preparation of execution environment</h3>

Chrome browser and Chrome Driver are required as an execution environment for JavaScript-compatible web scraping using Selenium::Chrome. Chrome Driver is software for operating Chrome itself. The environment construction procedure differs depending on the OS, refer to the following.

It's a good idea to match Chrome browser and Chrome Driver versions as much as possible to avoid binary compatibility issues.

<h4>For Unix/Linux</h4>

For other <a href="https://linux.perlclub.net/">UNIX/Linux</a> such as Ubuntu, Debian, FreeBSD, try searching for the Chrome browser itself and how to install the Chrome Driver. Let's do it.
