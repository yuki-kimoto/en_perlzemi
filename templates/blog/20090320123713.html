<h2>General-purpose constructor template</h2>



I will present a template of a general-purpose constructor. A general-purpose constructor template is a little difficult.

<h3>1. General-purpose constructor guidelines</h3>

A generic constructor should take into account not only when it is called from a class, but also when it is called from a <b> object </b>.

When called by the class

<pre>
my $book = Book->new;
</pre>

When called from an object

<pre>
my $book2 = $book->new
</pre>

Corresponds to both.

Another guideline is to separate the constructor and initialization process. I will create a <b> init method for initialization </b>.

<h3>2. Creating a generic constructor</h3>
The following is a general-purpose constructor template.
<pre>
sub new {
  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref $proto || $proto;
  my $self = {};
  bless $self, $class;
  
  $self->init(@_);
  return $self;
}

sub init {
  my ($self, @args) = @_;
  # Additional processing
}
</pre>

<h3>3. Processing to extract the class name from the object</h3>

I think this part is difficult to understand.
<pre>
  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref $proto || $proto;
</pre>
What this does is that if $proto is an object, use the <a href="/blog/20090318123712.html">ref function</a> to retrieve the associated class name. increase.

If not, I'm trying to just use the class name. If a string (class name) is passed to the <a href="/blog/20090318123712.html">ref function</a>, a false value will be returned and the right side of || will be executed.

That's why $class will contain the class name, whether it's called by the class name or by an object.

<h3>4. Separate initialization process</h3>

The following part separates the initialization process. If you want to initialize, create the object first with the bless function. Then call the init method from that object.

It's a little confusing, but let's get used to it. To call a method of the same class, you need to call it from an object, the blessed $self.

<pre>
  my $self = {};
  bless $self, $class;
  $self->init(@_);
</pre>

<h3>5. Why do you need to create it this way? </H3>

It's not good yet. I'll cover it in inheritance. I'll just say that if you don't create the object this way, you'll run into trouble when trying to inherit.
