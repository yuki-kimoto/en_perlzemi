<h2> Polymorphism with inheritance </h2>



One of the characteristics of object orientation is polymorphism. Polymorphism can be understood in the sense that <b> similar descriptions behave differently </b>.

<h3> 1. Make different behaviors depending on the class </h3>

Now, let's write a sample that behaves differently depending on the class to which you belong. A simple example is to concatenate strings with specific symbols. The Unix delimiter and the Windows delimiter are treated as samples.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

my $file_path_unix = FilePath :: Unix-> new;
my $file_path_win = FilePath :: Windows-> new;

my $unix_result = $file_path_unix-> cat_path ('a','b');
my $win_result = $file_path_win-> cat_path ('a','b');

print "unix: $unix_result \ n";
print "win: $win_result \ n";

# Base class for handling file paths
package FilePath :: Base;
sub new {
  my $proto = shift;
  my $class = ref $proto || $proto;
  my $self = {};
  bless $self, $class;
  return $self;
}

sub cat_path {
  my ($self, $str1, $str2) = @_;
  return $str1. $Self-> delimiter. $Str2;
}


# For Unix
package FilePath :: Unix;
use base'FilePath :: Base';

# Unix delimiter
sub delimiter {return'/'}

# For Windows
package FilePath :: Windows;
use base'FilePath :: Base';

# Delimiter for Windows
sub delimiter {return'\\'}
</pre>
When you run this sample

<pre>
unix: a / b
win: a \ b
</pre>

It will be displayed.

<h3> 2. Pay attention to the behavior of cat_path </h3>

First of all, the characteristic of this sample is that the method called cat_path has two meanings.

<pre>
package FilePath :: Base;
sub new {...}

sub cat_path {
  my ($self, $str1, $str2) = @_;
  return $str1. $Self-> delimiter. $Str2;
}
</pre>

If you look at the class FilePath :: Base, there is a method called cat_path. By the way, if you look at the part that calls cat_path, the object of File :: Path class is not created.

<pre>
my $file_path_unix = FilePath :: Unix-> new;
my $file_path_win = FilePath :: Windows-> new;

my $unix_result = $file_path_unix-> cat_path ('a','b');
my $win_result = $file_path_win-> cat_path ('a','b');
</pre>

Objects of the FilePath :: Unix class and FilePath :: Windows class have been created, respectively.

This is because FilePath :: Unix and FilePath :: Windows inherits his FilePath :: Base, as explained in <a href="/blog/20090324123747.html"> Inheritance</a>. , FilePath :: I was able to call the method of the Base class, cat_path.

The next thing to pay attention to is the description of $self-> delimiter in cat_path.

<h3> 3. Call a subclass method in the superclass. </h3>

Let's pay attention to the inside of cat_path.

<pre>
sub cat_path {
  my ($self, $str1, $str2) = @_;
  return $str1. $Self-> delimiter. $Str2;
}
</pre>
In cat_path, the delimiter method is called. However, FilePath :: Base does not have a method called delimiter. Can I call a method I don't have?

Actually, there is a secret in this $self part.

<pre>
my $unix_result = $file_path_unix-> cat_path ('a','b');
</pre>

When you call the cat_path method like this, the object assigned to $self is the FilePath :: Unix class object.

The FilePath :: Unix class has a delimiter method, so you can call the delimiter method from within the cat_path method.

<h3> 4. The FilePath :: Base class is an incomplete class that is intended to be inherited. </h3>

If you create an object of the FilePath :: Base class, cat_file will fail if you try to call the delimiter method internally.

<pre>
my $file_path_base = FilePath :: Base-> new;
$file_path_base-> cat_file ('a','b'); # Failure!
</pre>

A class that implements the delimiter method that inherits the FilePath :: Base class will be created and meaningful.

I would like to name such a class <b> inherited class </b>. (I couldn't find a proper name for such a class in a Perl book, so I'll call it a <b> inherited class </b>. It's called a Java abstract class because it can create objects. Not really)

<h3> 5. Defining methods in subclasses </h3>

And notice that the FilePath :: Unix class and the FilePath :: Windows class have different implementations of the delimiter method to achieve polymorphism.

<pre>
# FilePath :: Unix class
sub delimiter {return'/'}
</pre>

<pre>
# FilePath :: For Windows class
sub delimiter {return'\\'}
</pre>
This description is the part that substantially changes the behavior of the output result.
<pre>
unix: a / b
win: a \ b
</pre>
