<h2> Test :: Perform tests that cannot be performed with Mojo / Mojolicious </ h2>



Test :: Mojo is useful, but some tests cannot be run with the Test :: Mojo methods. For example, let's say you want to write a test that doesn't contain a string. In this case, the Test :: Mojo method cannot be used for testing.
In such cases, get the content directly and use the Test :: More method to test it. Content can be retrieved as "$ t-> tx-> res-> body".

<pre>
#Test to see that the content does not contain ppp
$ t-> get_ok ('/ foo');
my $ content = $ t-> tx-> res-> body;
is (index ($ content,'ppp'), -1);
</ pre>
