<h2> Lock the file using the lock file </h2>



You can also create a lock file and lock it. The advantage of creating a file for file locking and performing exclusive control is that the file to be updated can be deleted or renamed.

The following sample is a modification of the previous sample to use a lock file. The script for the loop is exactly the same as last time. Save the locking script as sample_20080815.pl and the loop script as data_20080815.txt.

Please refer to the previous sample for the execution method.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;
use Fcntl qw /:DEFAULT :flock :seek/;

# File for lock (create if not)
my $lock_file = "lock";
sysopen(my $lock_fh, $lock_file, O_RDONLY | O_CREAT)
  or die "Cannot open $lock_file: $!";

# Exclusive lock for lock file (exclusive lock because it is read and written)
flock($lock_fh, LOCK_EX)
  or die "Cannot lock $lock_file: $!";

# Be careful as it will be overwritten
my $file = "data_20080815.txt";

# Open in read/write mode (not very secure)
If there is no file with # O_CREAT, create it.
sysopen(my $fh, $file, O_RDWR | O_CREAT)
  or die "Cannot open $file: $!";

my $cnt;
$cnt = <$fh>;
if (! Defined $cnt && $!) {Die "Cannot read $file: $!";}

$cnt ++;

# Move the file pointer to the beginning
seek ($fh, 0, SEEK_SET)
  or die "Cannot seek $file: $!";

# write in.
print {$fh} $cnt
  or die "Cannot Write $file: $!";

# Truncate the file to write size
truncate ($fh, length $cnt);

close $fh
  or die "Cannot close $file: $!";

The file lock is released at the time of # close.
close $lock_fh
  or die "Cannot close $lock_file: $!";

print "Current count: $cnt\n";
</pre>

Loop script

<pre>
use strict;

use FindBin;

my $script = "$FindBin::Bin/sample_20080815.pl";

while (1) {
  system("perl $script");
  
  Random number less than # 1
  my $random = rand 1;
  sleep $random;
}
</pre>

The script is repeatedly executed using the <a href="/blog/20100123126425.html">while statement</a>.

<h3> Code explanation </h3>

<h4> (1) Create a lock file </h4>

<pre>
# Lock file (Note that it will be overwritten)
my $lock_file = "lock";
sysopen(my $lock_fh, $lock_file, O_RDONLY | O_CREAT)
  or die "Cannot open $lock_file: $!";
</pre>

Create a file for the lock.

<h4> (2) Lock the lock file using the flock function </h4>

The lock file is locked using the <a href="/blog/20080814121872.html">flock function</a>.

<pre>
# Exclusive lock for lock file (exclusive lock because it is read and written)
flock($lock_fh, LOCK_EX)
  or die "Cannot lock $lock_file: $!";
</pre>

Only the process that can lock this file should access the file to be updated. Following this lock, open the file to be updated and update the file.

<h4> (3) Unlock </h4>

<pre>
The file lock is released at the time of # close.
close $lock_fh
  or die "Cannot close $lock_file: $!";
</pre>

The lock is released by closing the lock file.
