<h3>Installation of Perl on Windows</h3>

Let's install Perl on <b>Windows</b>. I explain the way to use Strawberry Perl, ActivePerl, and msys2.

<h4>Installation of Strawberry Perl</h4>

Strawberry Perl is one of the Perl distributions on Windows. Strawberry Perl is easy to install and comes with a C language compiler "MinGW", a CPAN module installer "cpanm", and a C library that is often used for image processing.

<h4>Installation of ActivePerl</h4>

ActivePerl is also one of the Perls configured to use Perl on Windows. This is recommended if you want to link with Windows applications such as Excel or create GUI screens.

<h4>Installation of msys2 and Perl</h4>

msys2 is a tool that allows you to build a pseudo Linux environment on Windows.

For example, on Windows, <a href="/blog/20161103147817.html">interprocess communication</a> features usually don't work, but on msys2 they work.

This will allow modules that rely on interprocess communication, such as <a href="https://en.mojolicious.perlzemi.com/">Mojolicious</a> development web server, to work fine.

If you want to experience web development on Windows, this is the recommended method.

<h3>Installation Perl on Mac</h3>

Perl is installed by default on Mac, but you can also install the latest Perl in your environment.

If Perl can be installed in the user environment, it will not pollute the system environment, so it is also the recommended method.

The following article explains how to install Perl on macOS.

<h3>Installation Perl on Linux</h3>

This is an explanation of how to install Perl on Linux. If you want to develop or publish <a href="https://en.webapp.perlzemi.com/">web app</a> in Perl, <a href="https://linux.perlzemi." You will often use a com /">Linux server</a>. Perl is a UNIX-born programming language, and Linux is a UNIX derivative. Perl works well with Unix and Linux.
