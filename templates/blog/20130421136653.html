<h2> GitPrep-Install a portable Github system on Unix / Linux </h2>



<strong> GitPrep </strong> is a clone of <strong> Github </strong>, a web application <strong> GitPrep </strong> that allows you to install a portable Github system on Unix / Linux. It's very easy to install and you can install it with just one command.

I started writing the functions of Github for my own desire to use it for free at companies, etc., but gradually the functions have become complete and anyone can use it. Version 1.0 has been released. Without Github, a tool called git can only be recognized as svn, which is difficult to use, so I think it would be convenient to have such a tool for migrating internal repositories from svn.

You can create <strong> users unlimited </strong> and <strong> private repositories </strong>. GitPrep itself is open source, so you can use it for free. Since it can be installed on a shared rental server such as Sakura rental server, there is no need to be aware of advertisements and user registration.
