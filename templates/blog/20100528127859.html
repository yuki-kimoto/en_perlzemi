<h2> utf8 - Converts a string written in UTF-8 of the source code to an internal string </h2>



The <strong> utf8 </strong> module allows you to convert a string written in UTF-8 in your source code to an internal string.

<pre>
# Convert a string written in UTF-8 in the source code to an internal string
use utf8;
my $message ='aiueo';
</pre>

Save the source code in UTF-8. The string'aiueo'is automatically converted to an internal string.

<h3> FAQ about utf8 pragma </h3>

Q, Regarding the function of the utf8 pragma, can you think that the UTF-8 byte string is converted to an internal string using the decode function of the Encode module?
A. Yes. Think of it as doing the following:

<pre>
Write the same process using the # Encode module
my $str ='aiueo';
$str = decode ('UTF-8', $str);
</pre>

Q. I've heard about the UTF-8 flag, but can I think that the utf8 pragma does the process of setting the UTF-8 flag?

A. The interpretation is wrong. If the string in the source code consists of characters in the ASCII range, the utf8 pragma will not set the UTF-8 flag on the string, and if it contains characters outside the ASCII range, it will be in the UTF-8 flag. Stand up.

This makes it very difficult to understand what you are doing from the programmer's point of view. So don't be afraid to remember that the utf8 pragma converts a UTF-8 byte string into an internal string.

Q. Should I forget about the UTF-8 flag?
A. Yes, basically forget about it. But there is one thing that is useful to remember, so let me tell you. That is, "If the UTF-8 flag is set, it can be said that it is an internal string." The opposite is not true. There is a <strong> utf8 :: is_utf8 </strong> function as a function to check if the UTF-8 flag is set. If you use this function to verify that the UTF-8 flag is set, you can say that it is an internal string.

<pre>
Internal string if # UTF-8 flag is set
my $utf8_flagged = utf8 :: is_utf8 ($str);

if ($utf8_flagged) {
  # $str is an internal string
}
else {
  # $str is an internal string or a byte string
}
</pre>
