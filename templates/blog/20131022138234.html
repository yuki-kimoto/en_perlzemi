<h2>Learn the basics of PDL</h2>



I would like to write an introduction to PDL so that people who are doing statistical analysis in R language can perform statistical analysis work using PDL in Perl. If PDL, Perl's statistical analysis library, becomes available, it will be possible to perform statistical processing of multi-column data as in Excel.

First, let's create the simplest one-dimensional data structure. Take a look at the following code. You can use the <strong> pdl </strong> function to create a one-dimensional data structure.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

use PDL;

# Create data
my $nums = pdl [2, 4, 7];

# Data output
print $nums;
</pre>

When I run this example, I get the following output on the screen:

<pre>
[2 4 7]
</pre>

<h3>Creating PDL variables</h3>

You can first create a PDL variable using the pdl function. First, load the PDL to use the minimum functions of the PDL.

<pre>
use PDL;
</pre>

After loading the PDL, you can use the pdl function. Use the pdl function to create a PDL variable.

<pre>
my $nums = pdl [2, 4, 7];
</pre>

<h3>Data acquisition and modification</h3>

The data created by the pdl function is called a PDL variable. Let's get the elements of a one-dimensional PDL variable. Use the <strong> at </strong> method to get the data.

<pre>
my $first = $nums->at(0);
my $second = $nums->at(1);
</pre>

In the above example, we got the value of the element contained in the PDL variable, but we can also get it as a PDL variable.

There are several ways to get some data as PDL variables, but it's easier to write in nice slice notation. Read the PDL::NiceSlice module for writing nice slice notation. This is done at the beginning of the script.

<pre>
use PDL::NiceSlice;
</pre>

To get an element as a PDL variable, use the notation <strong> $variable name (index) </strong>.

<pre>
# Get element as PDL variable
my $pdl_first = $nums (0);
my $pdl_second = $nums (1);
</pre>

These are PDL variables, so if you want to get the element value itself, you can retrieve it with the <strong> at </strong> method.

<pre>
my $first = $pdl_first->at(0);
my $second = $pdl_second->at(0);
</pre>

If you want to change the value of an element, use nice slice notation as well. Use the <strong>. = </Strong> operator. . = Is overridden for assignment, not string concatenation.

<pre>
# Change the value of the element
$nums (0). = 5;
</pre>

PDL also allows you to extract multiple parts of a PDL variable as a new PDL variable. Let's extract the second and third elements. You can extract a part of the PDL variable by using the notation <strong> $variable name (n: m) </strong> as follows.

<pre>
my $pdl_parts = $nums (1: 2);
</pre>

You can also assign values to all the elements of the extracted PDL variable.

<pre>
$nums (1: 2). = 8;
</pre>

The feature of PDL is that the same operation can be performed on the set of parts extract in this way.

Let's get the length of one-dimensional data. Use the <strong> dims </strong> method to get the length of the data.

<pre>
my $length = $nums->dims;
</pre>

<h3>Example</h3>

This is an example that can be executed.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;

# Create data
my $nums = pdl [2, 4, 7];

# Element output
print $nums->at(0) . "\n";
print $nums->at(1) . "\n";

# Retrieving PDL variables
my $pdl_first = $nums (0);
my $pdl_second = $nums (1);

# Substitution
$nums (0). = 5;

# Getting multi-element PDL variables
my $pdl_parts = $nums (1: 2);

# Assignment to multiple elements retrieved as PDL variable
$nums (1: 2). = 8;

print $nums . "\n";
</pre>

<h3>Four arithmetic operations of constants</h3>

Use the <strong> + </strong> operator to add the same value to all values of a <strong> PDL variable </strong>.

<pre>
use PDL;
my $pdl = pdl [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3];
my $pdl_add = $pdl + 3;
</pre>

Do the same for <strong> subtraction </strong>, <strong> multiplication </strong>, <strong> division </strong>, <strong> quotient </strong>, and <strong> exponentiation </strong>. can do.

<pre>
# Subtraction
my $pdl_sub = $pdl - 3;

# Multiplication
my $pdl_product = $pdl * 3;

# Division
my $pdl_div = $pdl/3;

# Quotient
my $pdl_quotient = $pdl % 3;

# Exponentiation
my $pdl_pow = $pdl + 3;
</pre>

Multiplication and division correspond to constant multiples of the vector. Keep in mind that you are doing operations between PDL variables and ordinary values, not operations between PDL variables.

<h3>Extract unique values</h3>

Use the <strong> uniq method </strong> to retrieve the <strong> unique value </strong>.

<pre>
my $pdl_uniq = $pdl->uniq;
</pre>

<h3>Four arithmetic operations between PDL variables</h3>

To add <strong> PDL variables </strong>, use the <strong> + </strong> operator for PDL variables. Each element is added.

<pre>
# Addition of PDL variables
my $pdl1 = pdl [1, 2, 3];
my $pdl2 = pdl [4, 5, 6];
my $pdl_add = $pdl1 + $pdl2;
</pre>

Do the same for <strong> subtraction </strong>, <strong> multiplication </strong>, <strong> division </strong>, <strong> quotient </strong>, and <strong> exponentiation </strong>. can do. Each element is calculated.

<pre>
# Subtraction
my $pdl_sub = $pdl1-$pdl2;

# Multiplication
my $pdl_product = $pdl1 * $pdl2;

# Division
my $pdl_div = $pdl1/$pdl2;

# Quotient
my $pdl_quotient = $pdl1 %$pdl2;

# Exponentiation
my $pdl_pow = $pdl1 + $pdl2;
</pre>

Addition and subtraction corresponds to addition and subtraction of vectors.

<h3>Dot product</h3>

There is no special way to calculate the dot product. To calculate the <strong> inner product </strong>, multiply the PDL variables and then find the sum.

<pre>
# Dot product
my $inner_product = ($pdl1 * $pdl2)->sum;
</pre>

The result of the dot product is just a value, not a PDL variable.

<h3>Example</h3>

This is an example that can be executed.

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

use PDL;

# Addition
my $pdl = pdl [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3];
my $pdl_add = $pdl + 3;

# Subtraction
my $pdl_sub = $pdl - 3;

# Multiplication
my $pdl_product = $pdl * 3;

# Division
my $pdl_div = $pdl/3;

# Quotient
my $pdl_quotient = $pdl % 3;

# Get unique value
my $pdl_uniq = $pdl->uniq;

# Calculation result
print "$pdl_add\n";
print "$pdl_sub\n";
print "$pdl_product\n";
print "$pdl_div\n";
print "$pdl_quotient\n";
print "$pdl_uniq\n";
</pre>

<pre>
use strict;
use warnings;

use PDL;

# Addition of PDL variables
my $pdl1 = pdl [1, 2, 3];
my $pdl2 = pdl [4, 5, 6];
my $pdl_add = $pdl1 + $pdl2;

# Subtraction
my $pdl_sub = $pdl1-$pdl2;

# multiplication
my $pdl_product = $pdl1 * $pdl2;

# Division
my $pdl_div = $pdl1/$pdl2;

# Quotient
my $pdl_quotient = $pdl1 %$pdl2;

# Exponentiation
my $pdl_pow = $pdl1 + $pdl2;

# Dot product
my $inner_product = ($pdl1 * $pdl2)->sum;

# Calculation result
print "$pdl_add\n";
print "$pdl_sub\n";
print "$pdl_product\n";
print "$pdl_div\n";
print "$pdl_quotient\n";
print "$inner_product\n";
