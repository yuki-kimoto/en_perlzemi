<h2> Get / set environment variables% ENV </h2>



<b> Environment variables </b> can be acquired and set by using the special variable "% ENV".

<pre>
% ENV
</pre>

This environment variable is a <a href="/blog/20161013147635.html"> hash </a> with the environment variable name as the key.

For example, in the case of the environment variable "REMOTE_ADDR", you can refer to the value as follows.

<pre>
my $ remote_addre = $ ENV {REMOTE_ADDR};
</pre>

If you want to set environment variables, do as follows.

<pre>
$ ENV {MYAPP_MAX_CLIENT} = 10;
</pre>

<h4> What are environment variables? </H4>

Environment variables are like variables that the OS has. Environment variables are copied into the memory of the process space when the OS starts the process. OS environment variables cannot be changed from the process.

Environment variables can be set freely, but they are valid only in that process. When a process launches a child process, the environment variables are copied, as if the OS launched the process.
